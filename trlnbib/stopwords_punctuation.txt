# Punctuation characters we want to ignore as terms (i.e., when surrounded
# by whitespace in a query, like 'fred : the puppy') in queries
# FOR USE WITH FIELDS WHERE PUNCTUATION IS RETAINED (such as IDs)
#   see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-3085
# Note that hyphens, plusses, and double hyphens are not treated as terms
#   per debugQuery
