<!-- - PatternReplaceCharFilterFactory removes stand-alone punctuation,
          which gets dropped by the WDGF but an empty hole is left
          in the position and screws up phrase searches
     - ICUNormalizer2CharFilterFactory does nkfc normalization (ICU Normalizer2)
     - MappingCharFilterFactory does char-level expansion, (for example, flats and sharps)
